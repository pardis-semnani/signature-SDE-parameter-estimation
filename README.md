# Path-Dependent SDEs: Solutions and Parameter Estimation

This Macaulay2 code repository applies the Expected Signature Matching Method (ESMM) to the linear signature SDEs specified in the experiments in the paper "Path-Dependent SDEs: Solutions and Parameter Estimation."

The main code is presented in main.m2, which contains all the necessary functions for performing the ESMM.

The files config6.2, config6.3, and config6.4 contain the specific configurations needed for applying the ESMM to the linear signature SDEs described in the Experiments section of the paper. To apply this method to your preferred linear signature SDE, prepare a similar configuration file.

The code for simulating the data for parameter estimation, along with detailed usage instructions, is in the data_generation folder.
